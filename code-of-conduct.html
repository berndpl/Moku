<h1>The Moku Listener Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All listeners are required to act according to the following code of conduct. We encourage you to follow these guidelines which help steer our interactions and strive to keep the world a positive, growing project and community and help us provide and ensure a safe environment for everyone.</p>

<ol>
<li>What Moku believes in and how to act</li>
<li>Don’ts</li>
<li>For questions and feedback</li>
<li>Attribution</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name=“believe”>What Moku believes in and how to act</a></h2>

<p>As Moku listeners we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, personal ability or disability, ethnicity, religion, level of experience, set of skills or similar personal characteristic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>We believe that a diverse community where people treat each other with respect is stronger, more vibrant and has more potential contributors and more sources for ideas. We aim for more diversity.</li>
<li>We are kind, welcoming and courteous to everyone. We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments and their efforts.</li>
<li>We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.</li>
<li>We are aware that language shapes reality. Thus, we use inclusive, gender-neutral language in the documents we provide and when we talk to people.</li>
<li>When referring to a group of people, we aim to use gender-neutral terms like “team”, “folks”, “everyone”. (For details, we recommend this post).</li>
<li>We respect that people have differences of opinion and criticize constructively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Don’ts</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Don’t be mean or rude.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Don’t discriminate against anyone. Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive, we recognize that there are specific attributes that are used to discriminate against people. In alphabetical order, some of these attributes include (but are not limited to): age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental difference, politics, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and subculture. We welcome people regardless of the values of these or other attributes.</li>
<li>Sexism and racism of any kind (including sexist and racist “jokes”), demeaning or insulting behaviour and harassment are seen as direct violations to this code of conduct. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Derailing, tone arguments and otherwise playing on people’s desires to be nice are not welcome, especially in discussions about violations to this code of conduct.</li>
<li>Please avoid unstructured critique.</li>
<li>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.</li>
<li>Remixers and other parties that use Moku&#8217;s music are also subject to this code of conduct. These parties are required to not use sexualized images, activities, or other material which is not according to this code of conduct.</li>
</ul>

<h2>For questions and feedback</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or feedback on this code of conduct, Moku is happy to hear from you.</p>

<h2>Attribution</h2>

<p>This code of conduct is heavily inspired and based on the the <a href="http://hood.ie/code-of-conduct/">Hoodie Community Code of Conduct</a></p>
